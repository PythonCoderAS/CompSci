A keyword-based Chatbot for APCS.

The bot has three types of keywords. Phrase mode, multiple word mode, and a synonymial multiple word mode. All keywords are case-insensitive.

Phrase mode: The given line must contain the entire phrase (one word or multiple words) in it's entirety
Multiple Word mode: The given line must contain the given words, but they do not have to be right after each other, so as long as they're somewhere in the line, the response will trigger.
Synonymial Multiple Word mode: Same as Multiple Word mode, but some words have synonyms, meaning that one or more words for each "word" will trigger the response.
